# Homework3
I learned a lot from this project as this is the first game I did that didn't involve player interaction. Starting this project I honestly didn't even have a vision on what exactly I wanted to do so I kinda just went with an ocean themed game and went from there.
Me not having a vision for what I wanted to do kinda made it a little more complicated as I had no clue where to start or what to do. But with this I learned how to lerp ovjects from one point to another and to make objects chase and flee. Also I liked learning how to make spawner because it helped me learn how to spawn more objects in my ecosystem so it doesn't just have no new growing organisms if that makes sense. I'm not too confident on t his project as I feel like my game is really janky and a bit buggy, but I've crashed out over it a lot to where I'm somewhat happy with what I ended up with because it was to the point where my game wasn't even working haha. So just having a working  game made me happy which is a win in itself for me :)
